hangman

Hangman the pythonic wayYou  have  been  hired  by  an  English  teaching  company  to  develop  a  hangman  game.  The game consists of two parts, one part thinks of a word and places the number of stripes that match the word and the other part guessesbyletters. For each letter guessedthat is not contained in the word, an additional part of the hangman's body is drawn. For each letter that  matches,  the  line  is  replaced  by  the  letter.  If  the  whole  hanged  man  is  drawn,  the guesser loses. If the word is guessed before the hangman is drawn, the guesser wins. Keep in mind, who is the client to select if the computer generates the word and the user guesses, or  if  the  player  generates  the  word  and  the  computer  guesses,or  if  bothfeatures  are needed.You can look for complementary information, and you will be given a hangmanto use if you need it. You can design the game as you wish!
